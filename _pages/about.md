I am a PhD candidate in Bioengineering at Caltech, where I work with [Richard Murray](https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page) in his synthetic biology group. Previously I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the College of William and Mary, where I participated in the 2015 and 2016 iGEM teams and supervised the 2017 team. Beginning in summer 2023 I will be a Resnick Sustainability Institute postdoctoral scholar at Caltech supervised by [Bruce Hay](https://haylab.caltech.edu/), studying horizontal gene transfer in soils.

My work focuses on enabling a rigorous foundation for the reliable engineering of microbes in soil environments. I approach this goal both from the engineering angle, by developing new molecular tools and theoretical frameworks for genetic circuit design, and from the scientific angle, by studying fundamental questions about gene regulation and microbial physiology in varying environments.
