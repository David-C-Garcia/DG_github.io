<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a Senior Research Scientist at DEVCOM CBC and the California Institute of Technology under the mentorship of Matthew Lux and [Richard Murray](https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page), respectively, where I am applying machine learning methods to the high-throughput discovery of biological catalysts. The goal of my work is to understand the fundamental building blocks of complex biological systems and their interactions as a means of developing biological tools that can function robustly, predictably, and with quantitative precision.

In my work, I utilize the tools of cell-free synthetic biology to perform high-throughput characterization of cell-free biological systems with the goal of both understanding their fundamental function and improving their ability to generate novel mechanisms for biological sensing and biological production.  Please see the [Research](/research/) page for more details.


I received my PhD in Energy Science and Engineering from the University of Tennesee, Knoxville and Oak Ridge National Laboratory under the supervision of [Mitchel J Doktycz](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/mitchel-j-doktycz).
