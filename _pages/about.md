I am a Resnick Sustainability Institute postdoctoral scholar at Caltech supervised by [Bruce Hay](https://haylab.caltech.edu/). My work aims to enable a rigorous foundation for translating synthetic biology advances in the laboratory into the deployment environment, with a particular focus on applications related to sustainability. I approach this goal both from the engineering angle, by developing new theoretical frameworks and molecular implementations for genetic circuit design, and from the scientific angle, by studying fundamental questions about gene regulation and microbial physiology in variable environments. Please see the [Research](/research.md) page for more details.

I received my PhD in Bioengineering from Caltech, under the supervision of [Richard Murray](https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page). Previously I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the College of William and Mary, where I was a member of the 2015 and 2016 iGEM teams and supervised the 2017 team.
