Engineerable biological systems have the potential to be some of our greatest tools against a host of problems, from biological and chemical threats to human health, to food insecurity, and the sustainable production of materials. Understanding the fundamental building blocks of complex biological systems and their interactions lies at the heart of creating biological tools that can function robustly, predictably, and with quantitative precision.

The open nature of cell-free systems enables a modular approach to biological transformations enabling distinct biological components to be characterized rapidly and with precise control of the chemical environment.

My current project focuses on the use protein language models to interrogate substrate specificity and promiscuity of novel biocatalysts using the biological polymer melanin as a model system.


Cell-free synthetic biology offers tools to meet our growing need to address challenges spanning the gamut from medical and environmental diagnostics to the production of complex molecules. These methods reconceptualize how biological systems are engineered for applications in health, materials, and energy. Instead of making concessions between the cellâ€™s physiological and evolutionary objectives compared to engineerable objectives. My lab will focus on developing new strategies that expand our traditional models of biomanufacturing by taking a data-driven and multiplexed approach to elucidate fundamental principles that allow for scalable cell-free synthetic biology.

My future work will focus on three key approaches to take a holistic approach to generating the tools and fundemental knowledge to develop cell-free systems as scalable biomanufacturing platform: computationally driven design of biosensors, machine learning-enabled materials production, and fundamental explorations of cell-free metabolism towards small molecule production.
