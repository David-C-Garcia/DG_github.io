title: "Synthetic microbiology in sustainability applications"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Conjugation
excerpt: 'Engineered microbes have great potential for addressing the many sustainability challenges that we face today. In this review, Ethan Jones and I develop an organizing framework for the various classes of applications of synthetic biology for sustainability. We use the property of environmental interfacing, the extent to which the engineered microbe is exposed to the natural environment in its deployment context, to categorize applications areas into three domains: Factory, Farm, and Field. This framework reveals common principles and challenges shared by application areas that are typically viewed as disparate, revealing important research directions that cross disciplinary boundaries.'
