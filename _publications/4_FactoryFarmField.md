title: "Synthetic microbiology in sustainability applications"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Conjugation
excerpt: 'Engineered microbes have great potential for addressing the many sustainability challenges that our world is facing. In this review, Ethan Jones and I develop an organizing framework for applications of synthetic biology in sustainability. We use the property of <i>environmental interfacing</i>, the extent to which the engineered microbe is exposed to the natural environment in its deployment context, to organize applications areas into three domains: Factory, Farm, and Field. This framework reveals common principles and challenges shared by application areas that are typically viewed as disparate.'
