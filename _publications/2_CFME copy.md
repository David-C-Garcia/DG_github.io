title: "A lysate proteome engineering strategy for enhancing cell-free metabolite production"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/CFME
excerpt: 'Elucidating the interaction networks associated with secondary metabolite production in microorganisms is an ongoing challenge made all the more daunting by the rate at which DNA sequencing technology reveals new genes and potential pathways. Developing the culturing methods, expression conditions, and genetic systems needed for validating pathways in newly discovered microorganisms is often not possible. In this work we describe an in vitro computationally assisted pathway description approach that employs bioinformatic searches of genome databases, protein structural modeling, and proteinâ€“ligand-docking simulations to predict the gene products most likely to be involved in a particular secondary metabolite production pathway. This information is then used to direct in vitro reconstructions of the pathway and subsequent confirmation of pathway activity using crude enzyme preparations.'
