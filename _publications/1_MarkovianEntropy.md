title: "A Markovian entropy measure for the analysis of calcium activity time series"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/MarkovianEntropy
excerpt: 'Unlike mature neurons, <i>Xenopus laevis</i> neural progenitors do not display stereotyped spiking behavior in their calcium dynamics, precluding the use of spike-counting algorithms to analyze time-series datasets. Jointly with Andy Halleran, we developed an algorithm that represents the calcium dynamics as a Markov process and calculates the entropy associated with the corresponding transition matrix. Our method was able to separate the calcium activity datasets from developmentally-distinct stages of progenitor cells more strongly than conventional methods.'
