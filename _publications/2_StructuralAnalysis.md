title: "A geometric and structural approach to the analysis and design of biological circuit dynamics: a theory tailored for synthetic biology"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/StructuralAnalysis
excerpt: "When synthetic biologists design and analyze genetic circuits, the mathematical tools and conceptual frameworks that we use typically come from other disciplines, like engineering and computer science. But what would it look like to have a mathematical theory that was specifically developed for biomolecular systems? Jointly with Fang Xiao, we propose just such a framework, focusing on the ubiquitous presence of saturation in biomolecular reactions. Our central insight is that a genetic circuit can be approximated by a set of simpler circuits depending on the system's saturation state, and by analyzing these simpler circuits, we find that dynamic properties like bistability and oscillations can actually be encoded at a more fundamental, structural level than could be seen with conventional analysis approaches."
