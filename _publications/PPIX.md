title: "Cell-Free Optimized Production of Protoporphyrins"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/PPIX
excerpt: 'In this work we take advantage of porphyrins as both a molecule of interest and as an easily detectable product in a cell-free extract to i) show our ability to produce porphyrins using enriched cell-free extracts, ii) explore consolidating the extract source cells into a single co-culture fermentation in order to limit the need for multiple extract productions, and iii) rapidly generate ideal cofactor and substrate mixtures using DBTL-cycles powered by Design of Experiments (DOE). We chose one porphyrin molecule, protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), as our target molecule due to its utility in chemical warfare agent degradation6 56 . We showcase the production of PPIX in cell57 free extracts and provide insights into how the production of extracts for CFME can be scaled and optimized towards cell-free biomanufacturing beyond the lab scale.'
