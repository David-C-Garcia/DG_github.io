title: "Addressable and adaptable intercellular communication via DNA messaging"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Conjugation
excerpt: 'By encoding messages into mobile DNA elements, one can massively scale up the bandwidth of intercellular communication channels in engineered bacterial populations. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1754-1611-6-16">Ortiz and Endy</a> first implemented this insight in 2012, but in the proceeding ten years there was little adoption of DNA-based communication by the field. Here I developed a modular and scalable framework for DNA-based communication that leverages its unique property of dynamic message mutability to enable messages to be programmatically addressed to specific recipients in a population, and for those messages to be editable <i>in situ</i> by the cells themselves.'
