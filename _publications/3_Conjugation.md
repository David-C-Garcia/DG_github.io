title: "Addressable, packet-based intercellular communication through plasmid conjugation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Conjugation
excerpt: 'By encoding messages into mobile DNA elements, one can massively scale up the bandwidth of intercellular communication channels in engineered bacterial populations. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1754-1611-6-16">Ortiz and Endy</a> first implemented this insight in 2012, but in the proceeding ten years there was little adoption of DNA-based communication by the fieldâ€” likely because the promiscuity of mobile DNA makes it difficult to ensure messages go only to their desired recipients. Here I developed a modular and scalable framework that enables DNA messages to be addressed to specific recipients within an engineered population.'
